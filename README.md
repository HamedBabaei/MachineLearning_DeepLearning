This is my solution for the Lab1 MIT 6.S191 course on Introduction to Deep Learning, 2020. on the lab 1 assignment. The goal was to train an RNN model to generate new songs. The training has been done using `Tensorflow` API on iris ABC songs. I create modules to make more fun doing assignments

* `rnnmodel.py`: is rnn model which used to build, compile, train, and generate new songs.
* `helper.py`: is a helper function for loading dataset, playing songs, and creating batches for training.
* `music-generation.ipynb`: contains the whole process of experimenting and doing this lab.
